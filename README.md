# deploydable_crypto-data-app

This is not nearly on being deploydable. But it was meant to be portfolio project, where I hopefully get back to with 
Next.js as fetching external cryptocoin data from API gives many possibilities to interrupt and visualize the data and
also offers an opportunity to use Next.js "Client-side rendering" to certain parts of it, but also to use server-side
rendering for the most of other things. 

But the time is not full yet for me to come back to this and probably need to build it from scrath.
